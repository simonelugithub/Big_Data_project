# Big Data Project
 Introduction
For the fall semester, Big Data Project was carried out in partnership with the company Alkemy. The project was part of the course on Big Data and Smart Data Analytics, and it focused on using advanced data analysis, statistical and Big data theory and techniques to gain insights from large datasets. Within this project, my team decided to implement theories and techniques from statistics, management, computer science and mathematics to arrive at the final goal. We concluded that to do a good project hard skills are not everything, but soft skills such as having creativity is also important. In addition, a multidisciplinary team is essential to arrive at all-round conclusions.

the first part concerns the first approach with the data, i.e. familiarisation, outlier detection and eda.
Subsequently, the objective was  to detect price leaders and followers in a given market and create a popularity index for each product.
Price leadership refers to a situation where one firm (the price leader) sets the price for a product or service, and other firms (the price followers) follow suit. This can occur in various markets, such as retail, real estate, and even online marketplaces.
By detecting price leaders and followers, we can gain a better understanding of the competitive dynamics of a market and how prices are determined. Additionally, the popularity index will provide insight into the demand for each product.

Data
The data for this project consists of historical price data for a selection of products in a online marketplace. the data provided included sales transactions, product catalogue, price comparison with other sellers, and click history of the product on the website.
