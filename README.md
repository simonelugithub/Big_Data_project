# Big Data Project
 Introduction

This project aims to detect price leaders and followers in a given market and create a popularity index for each product.

Price leadership refers to a situation where one firm (the price leader) sets the price for a product or service, and other firms (the price followers) follow suit. This can occur in various markets, such as retail, real estate, and even online marketplaces.

By detecting price leaders and followers, we can gain a better understanding of the competitive dynamics of a market and how prices are determined. Additionally, the popularity index will provide insight into the demand for each product.
Data

The data for this project consists of historical price data for a selection of products in a given market. The data includes the product names, prices, and dates.
Methodology

To detect price leaders and followers, we will analyze the price data using techniques such as time series analysis and statistical testing. We will also utilize machine learning algorithms, such as clustering, to group the products into price leader and follower categories.

To create the popularity index, we will use a combination of the product prices and the frequency at which they are purchased (if available). The popularity index will be calculated using a weighted average, with more weight given to recent purchases.
Results

The results of this project will include the identification of price leaders and followers for each product, as well as the calculated popularity index for each product. These results can be used to inform pricing strategies and make data-driven decisions about which products to promote.
Conclusion

This project aims to provide a better understanding of the competitive dynamics of a market and how prices are determined by detecting price leaders and followers. The popularity index will provide insight into the demand for each product.
